The package is designed to take bytecodes of a deployed smart contract and then check the pattern to give the probabilities of being it a scam or not.
This works for smart contract deployed on Base blockchain.
The app is built using Flask. One can post a json file having bytecode to the REST API and in response they get the probabilities of the bytecode being a scam or not.
